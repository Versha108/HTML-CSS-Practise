                    belonged to the royal family of Mewar. After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai
                    Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the
                    eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and Pratap ascended the throne as
                    Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the Sisodia Rajputs. He was crowned in
                    Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to join the armies
                    of Emperor Akbar who later gave him a portion of Sirohi.</p>
